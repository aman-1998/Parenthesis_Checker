Parenthesis_Checker

By checking whether all the parenthesis i.e., (, {, ], }, ), [ are placed correctly,

we can tell whether an expression is valid or not.

We can do this either by using stack or without stack. But using stack will be advantageous:

*Using a stack to balance parenthesis will help you balance different types of grouping operators 
such as [], {} and () and verify that they are correctly nested.

*Using a stack will also help improve the efficiency of the code


Sample Input:

Enter any string: 3346({{{90[9]}}788})

Sample Output:

Valid expression

Sample Input:

Enter any string: 946(565(7){67)}

Sample output:

Invalid expression
